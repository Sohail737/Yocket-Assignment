1. The cost for 1 sms is 0.02 dollar, and I have 100 dollars, that means 5000 sms
2. The quota of 5000 sms is being used within an hour whith significant less traffic, is something not right, and does require fix
3.Possible reasons due to which this might be happening
    a. The validtity time for OTP is very less due to which user is not able to login and might need to resend OTP several time.
        The possible fix for this issue is to increase validity time of OTP.
    b. Due to some condition in code, multiple OTP is being sent to user.
        The possible fix for this is to find the condition and correct it.
    c. The session time for a login is very less, and due to which user might need to login multiple times.
    The possible fix for this is to increase the session time for login.
